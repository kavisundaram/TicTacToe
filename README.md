# TicTacToe Webapp

## Project Description
The Tic Tac Toe App is a simple way for two players to play Tic Tac Toe with each other using their browsers. When one player starts a game, they invite another player and they are assigned X and O respectively. From then on, they take turns placing their shapes until one player gets three in a row. Players may also see their wins and losses tracked on a global leaderboard. This involves individual player tracking of stats and information.
